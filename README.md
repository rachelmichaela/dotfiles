### About `dotfiles`

`dotfiles` is a modest collection of dotfiles that I have put together to
augment my macOS, FreeBSD, and GNU/Linux environments.

As an individual who frequently reinstalls operating systems or has to use
new systems temporarily, having a collection of configuration files that I can
quickly source is invaluable in making each new environment familiar. This
familiarity encourages efficiency in workflows, as I must neither manually
configure the environment nor adapt to new paradigms for short periods of time.

This collection is inspired by the wealth of dotfile collections throughout
the Internet, and I encourage you to use any inspiration you find in my
collection as a prompt to create and share your own!

### What `dotfiles` are included?

Configuration files are provided for the following applications:
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) with
[Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/)

- [swaywm](https://swaywm.org/)
- [tcsh](https://www.tcsh.org/)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi/)

#### Dependencies

- Sublime Text requires the GitHub color scheme and GitHub theme packages. I
strongly recommend Vintageous, too.

#### Notes
